Phase 2

1. refactor
2. write unit tests
3. only push code that runs! (check that the main method in ATM doesn't crash)


Refactor (and add Phase 2 functionality)

1. AssetAccount (Dani)
2. CreditCard (Dani)
    - access modifiers
6. Deposit (Fatema)
10. Display classes (Arjun)
11. Account (Shourya)
    - joint accounts
ERRORS - ARJUN
- Bank Manager is not asked to set a default password for the user
- When user tries to change their password, the code crashes
- Need to store account data on text files, instead of RAM
- After creating an account, the program crashes when the user tries accessing their new account

Note

1. before deleting greyed-out methods in classes you're refactoring,
   check that these methods don't need to be used before deleting (i.e. if
   the method should be called in the main method but isn't yet, don't delete it!)
